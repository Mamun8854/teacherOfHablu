                SQL is the programming language used to interface with
                relational databases. (Relational databases model data as
                records in rows and tables with logical links between them).
                NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally
                do not use SQL. And five change such as <br />

                NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into
                EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven
                architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite
                loop that receives requests and processes them.
